Use widely adopted, non-proprietary file formats to store and exchange review data, including meta-data, protocols, evidence tables, and outputs.

**Why this matters**

- **Tool independence and longevity:** Standard formats reduce lock-in and keep the evidence accessible across multiple tools, or even when individual tools evolve.
- **Quality control and validation:** Human- and machine-readable formats support automated validation (schema checks, content validation) while enabling transparent human oversight (e.g., through readable Git diffs).
- **Reproducibility and traceability:** Clean text-based formats integrate well with version control, so changes can be reviewed and compared efficiently.

**Practical implementation**

- Use **BibTeX (`.bib`)** for bibliographic metadata and record-level information.
- Use **YAML (`.yml` / `.yaml`)** or **JSON (`.json`)** for structured artifacts such as search strategies and extracted evidence, with a preference for YAML due to its readability in version-controlled workflows.
- Prefer plain-text formats that support **stable diffs** in Git, so even small changes remain visible and reviewable.
- Document expected fields and conventions (e.g., required BibTeX keys; JSON schemas for search strategies) to ensure consistency across contributors.
