**The principle in action**

As an illustrative example, consider [this version-controlled literature review repository](https://github.com/fs-ise/C5-DM-vignette){target=_blank}:

**What to explore:**

- **Commit history:** Navigate to the *Commits* view to see how bibliographic records, screening decisions, and extracted evidence evolve over time.
- **File-level diffs:** Open individual commits to inspect precise changes to metadata (e.g., corrections, deduplication decisions, or extraction of evidence).
- **Reproducibility:** Possibility to fork or clone the repository locally and rerun processing steps to reproduce intermediate and final outcomes.
- **Auditability:** Commit messages and pull requests trace *who* changed *what*, *when*, and *why* of each change in the data.

**Why it matters**

- **One shared place for the evidence base**: A single repository helps teams coordinate on the same (meta)data, protocols, and outputs.
- **Transparent change history**: Every modification is recorded (who changed what, when, and why), enabling traceability of the evolving evidence base.
- **Stronger control over data quality**: Version control supports internal validation (e.g., through pull requests), training of reviewers based on standardized protocols, and rollback of problematic changes.

**Practical implementation**

- Maintain a **remote repository** (e.g., GitHub) for collaboration and backup, and **local clones** for day-to-day work and computation.
- Use **distributed version control** to leverage local computing resources (often cheaper and faster for researchers) for tasks like API querying, deduplication, and compute-intensive methods (ML/LLM) on full texts—while keeping results reproducible and auditable.
- Keep repositories **private by default** during active research, but make them **publicly accessible when appropriate**. When making a repository public, consider sharing **metadata** (e.g., primary records and extracted evidence) rather than raw search results or full-text PDFs, which may be subject to licensing restrictions. In **private repositories**, both metadata and raw materials (including PDFs) can be maintained; large binary files such as PDFs can be managed using **Git Large File Storage (Git LFS)** to keep the repository lightweight while preserving reproducibility and auditability.
